# ESP32-S3 ULP Playground

This respository is a playground for working with the ultra-low power RISC-V co-processor on the ESP32-S3.
It is configured, out-of-the-box to be used with the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 but should be easily modified to 
work with other ESP32 boards with a ULP such as the S2, etc.

The repository is organized in a set of branches that are meant to be followed like a tutorial. Simply 
check out the branch of the lesson.

`git checkout lesson-1`

Instructions for each lesson can be found in the **lessons** folder.

## Prerequisites
- Linux
- Docker
- VSCode with the Dev Containers extension installed 
- ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 or other ESP32 board with RISC-V ULP co-processor
